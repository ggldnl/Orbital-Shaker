# orbital_shaker

This project was born as a sort of remix of [this orbital shaker](https://learn.adafruit.com/crickit-lab-shaker/3d-printing) to adapt the hardware to what I had at the time at home; I got caught up in it and added many features via software, hardware and redesigning most of the cad files in fusion360, so I think it is safe to say that it is now a project on its own.
