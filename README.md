# Orbital Shaker

I needed something to help me out shaking the ferric chloride, sodium carbonate and acetone trays when making PCBs. You can check out [my guide](https://github.com/ggldnl/pcb_manufacturing.git) to manufacture PCBs at home. It ain't much but it's honest work

This project was born as a sort of remix of [this orbital shaker](https://learn.adafruit.com/crickit-lab-shaker/3d-printing) to adapt the hardware to what I had at the time at hands; I got caught up in it and added many features via software, hardware and redesigning most of the cad files in fusion360, so I think it is safe to say that this is now a project on its own. 

# Contributing and warn for possible bugs
There will probably still be small bugs (surely one in the soft start menu item), feel free to contribute in any way.
As soon as I have time I will rewrite the code from scratch by implementing the menu in my own way and without resorting to external libraries. Another thing to do would be to use custom (maybe animated) characters (https://www.engineersgarage.com/making-custom-characters-on-lcd-using-arduino/).
